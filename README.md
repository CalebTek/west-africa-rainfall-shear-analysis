# west-africa-rainfall-shear-analysis
This repository contains code and data for analyzing the relationship between boundary layer vertical wind shear and rainfall onset over West Africa. The project aims to investigate how atmospheric conditions, specifically wind shear in the boundary layer, influence the initiation of rainfall in the West African region.
